# ITC-html-css-project

The project is to create a responsive webpage using only HTML and CSS. Follow the Figma design (see below). Your page should be responsive, which means it should look good on both a mobile device and desktop screens. To help you with this aspect of the assignment, the Figma design includes designs for mobile and desktop.

Your final product should look exactly as the design! You don't want the designers to yell at you for not following their design perfectly. We encourage you to write your own CSS. However, you can use Bootstrap for styling if you prefer.

In the Figma files, you will find the CSS style properties that the designer used for things like sizes, margin, padding, colors, fonts, icons and more. Those styles are very helpful, but you should know that the layout style properties (like position, top, right, bottom, left) are not always on point. You may find that you don't use the same exact layout properties from the Figma design in your work.

The Figma design has a few charts. You DO NOT need to create the charts using HTML and CSS. Instead, you can export the images from Figma and use them in your website. When you do this, be sure to export only the charts. This isn't an excuse to avoid writing HTML and CSS where you otherwise know how to.

The general layout code should be done by Saturday night at midnight. When working with the Figma design, you may want to login to Figma and copy the design to your own drafts. Then, you have a private copy to work from and therefore won't see your classmates moving around in the file.
